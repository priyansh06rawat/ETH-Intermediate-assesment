# heading Functions and Errors
In our Module 1 project of the ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM course by Metacrafter, we'll develop a smart contract utilizing the `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert` functions. These functions are crucial for error handling in Solidity. Proper error management ensures the smart contract executes successfully and helps save users' gas by efficiently using the `revert` function.
